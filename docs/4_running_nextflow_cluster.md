## Running nextflow on the HPC

This section is primarily a demo with tips & tricks on how to run on an HPC, specifically the Cannon and O2 clusters at Harvard. 

This section should take 20-30 minutes and is mostly a demo. 

### How to install & run nextflow on the cluster

If you are attending this workshop, you should be using nextflow in a GitHub codespace, where everything is already installed. If you want to run nextflow on your own computer or (more likely) on the high performance computing cluster (HPC)
