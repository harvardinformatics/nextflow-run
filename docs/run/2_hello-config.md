### Run hello-config

hello-config is like hello-nextflow, except the user needs to specify an input csv and some parameters (like which specific tools to run)

Learning goals

* Brief digression about conda vs singularity
* Learn about editing config files
* Learn about running nextflow with parameters and the difference between workflow specific parameters and nextflow options
* Learn how to change compute resources for a specific task using either config or command line
* Run nextflow with report to generate resource utilization report

Activities:
Run hello nextflow using conda vs using singularity
Run hello nextflow with different amounts of cpus
Run hello nextflow with report
